## Dataset

The dataset for this project is available on Kaggle's competition page: [Dog Breed Identification](https://www.kaggle.com/c/dog-breed-identification/data). The dataset contains the following files:

- `train/` - A directory containing training images labeled with their respective breeds.
- `test/` - A directory containing test images without labels that you'll use for making predictions.
- `labels.csv` - A CSV file mapping each image's filename to its corresponding breed.
- `sample_submission.csv` - A CSV file for submitting your predictions to the Kaggle competition.

## Project Structure

The project is organized as follows:

- `data/` - Directory where you should place the dataset.
- `models/` - Saved model checkpoints will be stored here.
  
## Usage

1. **Data Preparation**: Place the downloaded dataset into the `data/` directory.

2. **Exploratory Data Analysis**:  directory to explore the dataset, visualize the images, and gain insights into the data.

3. **Model Building**: directory to build and train the MobileNetV2-based model for dog breed identification.

4. **Evaluation**: Evaluate the model's performance using evaluation metrics like accuracy, and analyze any misclassified images.

5. **Making Predictions**: Utilize the trained model to make predictions on the test set. The submission format should adhere to the competition's guidelines.
